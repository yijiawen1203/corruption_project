I need to change the above figure into grayscale, so i need to change: make them different shapes, like circles, squares, and triangles. and keep consistency across figures. make them different shades of gray/black/or hollow circles. I do it in the following file  **/Users/yoga/Documents/Projects/4 合作项目 腐败 economic corruption/63_top organization network and centrality 20220617/3 draw email network for whole period.ipynb**

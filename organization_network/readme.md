I need to change the above figure into grayscale, so i need to change: make them different shapes, like circles, squares, and triangles. and keep consistency across figures. make them different shades of gray/black/or hollow circles. I do it in the following file  new code path: **/Users/yoga/Documents/Projects/4 合作项目 腐败 economic corruption/62_planner network202207/3 draw organization network with planner node.ipynb**

update the figure 4 in the paper to make it clearer. the changing points include: add a text shadow for the words in the figure. move the words below the icon. and if needed, move the node location to make it clearer. I update the figure in the following path:  **/Users/yoga/Documents/Projects/4 合作项目 腐败 economic corruption/62_planner network202207/3 draw organization network with planner node.ipynb**

updated at 20221213: reproduce this network graph with city commissioners, CRA members, and planners.  (1) remove all labels; (2) switch the color of CRA and planners, CRA should be green, and planners should be orange (this is to keep consistency with the red for commissioners, and green for CRA in the previous key decision maker graph); (3) put CRA in the outer circle and planners in the middle circle.

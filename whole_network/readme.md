this folder include code for the large network


for myself reference, the path of the notebook:
**/Users/yoga/Documents/Projects/4 合作项目 腐败 economic corruption/65_update_the graph_of_joey_and_yijia_in_paper_202206/5 edited concentric network with 4 color notation_yijia.ipynb**

draw whole network without any label: **/Users/yoga/Documents/Projects/4 合作项目 腐败 economic corruption/65_update_the graph_of_joey_and_yijia_in_paper_202206/5_2 edited concentric network with 4 color notation_yijia.ipynb**

update on 202305: for JAPA review
== 

based on reviewer's comment, the figure 3 for mean and variance of dc bc cc centrality needs to change. Specifically, i need to delete so many time on the x axis, and make it easier to see.  The notebook is the **/Users/yoga/Documents/Projects/4 合作项目 腐败 economic corruption/65_update_the graph_of_joey_and_yijia_in_paper_202206/4 centrality & density evaluation over time plot_edited by yijia 20230520.ipynb**

Next, i need to add reciprocity and random walk betweenness centrality, the notebooks is  **/Users/yoga/Documents/Projects/4 合作项目 腐败 economic corruption/65_update_the graph_of_joey_and_yijia_in_paper_202206/3 build adjacency matrix and calculate centrality_edited_yijia20230520.ipynb**
# 3 号是计算centrality。
# 4 号是在计算的基础上画图。
